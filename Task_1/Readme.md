# Iris Flower Classification Project

This project was developed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship. The goal of the project is to classify iris flowers into three different species: Iris-versicolor, Iris-setosa, and Iris-virginica. The classification is based on various features provided in the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains samples of iris flowers, each labeled with the corresponding species. The dataset includes features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Models

Several machine learning models were employed to perform the classification task:

1. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
2. K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
3. Gaussian Naive Bayes
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. Stochastic Gradient Classifier

## Implementation

The project was implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. Each model was trained on the dataset, and the performance metrics were evaluated to determine the effectiveness of each algorithm.
