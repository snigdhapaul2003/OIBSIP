# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning ðŸš—ðŸ’°

## Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project for the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship. This project focuses on predicting the selling price of cars based on various features using three regression models: Linear Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.

## Dataset ðŸ“Š

The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of the following columns:

- Car_Name
- Year
- Selling_Price
- Present_Price
- Driven_kms
- Fuel_Type
- Selling_type
- Transmission
- Owner

## Objective ðŸŽ¯

The primary objective of this project is to build predictive models that can accurately estimate the selling price of cars based on the given features. This can be valuable for both buyers and sellers in the used car market.

## Regression Models ðŸ¤–

### 1. Linear Regressor

The Linear Regressor is a simple regression model that assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable (selling price).

### 2. Random Forest Regressor

The Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning model that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is robust and performs well in capturing complex relationships in the data.

### 3. Gradient Boosting Regressor

The Gradient Boosting Regressor is another ensemble learning technique that builds multiple weak models sequentially, with each model correcting the errors of the previous one. It often yields high predictive accuracy.
