# Email Spam Detection Project

This project was conducted during the Oasis Infobyte internship and focuses on Email Spam Detection using machine learning. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle, and various techniques were employed for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Kaggle Email Spam Collection](https://www.kaggle.com/your-dataset-link).

## Techniques Used

- **Vectorization Techniques:**
  - Count Vectorizer
  - TF-IDF Vectorizer

- **Classifiers:**
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression

## Implementation

Two vectorization techniques were used to convert text data into numerical features: Count Vectorizer, which represents the occurrence of each word, and TF-IDF Vectorizer, which weighs the importance of each word in the document.

Two classifiers, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, were employed for the classification task.
